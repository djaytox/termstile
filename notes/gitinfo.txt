Instructions for using Git/Github:

Before you work: 
	git pull
After you work: 
	git commit -am 'enter your message here'
	git status (read what it says, if there are any errors, also make sure you only touched files you meant to)
	git pull
	git push
	
When the weird text editor (vim) comes up: 
	: before commands
	esc to enter command mode
	i to enter insert mode
	w to write
	q to quit
